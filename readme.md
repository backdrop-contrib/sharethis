INTRODUCTION
------------

Sharethis places those "Share with..." icons/links on the content on your page.

Integration with the ShareThis social bookmarking utility on selected node types.

The code for this project was based on the original share project for Drupal 5.x. The code for this project has been trimmed down to only work with the ShareThis system, and not require any additional modules to work properly.

Features

Customize your ShareThis code using the STAPI

Select node types you wish to display ShareThis module on

Choose to display in $teaser view or not

Choose to display the ShareThis link in either the $link items, or in the $node->content itself

Customize the weight of the ShareThis link if in $node placement

Uses the ShareThis jQuery plugin so the ShareThis servers are queried after page rendering

Place a ShareThis block anywhere on your site

Views integration

TESTED
-----

Simple Working in Backdrop 1.0 -- placement and working sharing in node content and blocks only so far.

KNOWN ISSUES
---------------------

None critical for Backdrop yet.  Using a different way to append Sharethis than the theme_mymodule function in the original Drupal module until I/someone explains the theming system in Backdrop better than I understand it.
